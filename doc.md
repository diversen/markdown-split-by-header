# Git to Book Documentation

## Quickstart

**Gittobook** (git-to-book) is an easy way to write to multiple formats using markdown. It transforms a git repository containing markdown files into Epub, Mobi, and PDF. These formats are often formats used to create books - online ebooks or for books for print. 

It is basically a bridge between **pandoc** ([http://pandoc.org](http://pandoc.org)) and **git**. Pandoc is used to generate the different output formats, and git repositories are used to store the written markdown files, and assets, such as templates, CSS, fonts, and images. The aim is to enable people to use git when writing large text documents, which has to be transformed into different formats.  

There is a online version, which you can log into. This can be found on [http://gittobook.org](http://gittobook.org). The online version will export to Epub, Mobi, PDF and HTML, but with some restrictions in templates and options. 

When you add a new git repo URL to the system, gittobook will checkout the repo, and look for any markdown files (`.md`). It will always checkout the `default` branch - this is often `master`, but does not have to be. The markdown files found are then collected into one document, which is transformed using pandoc.

=============

You can browse this documentation on the github.com repository location ([https://github.com/diversen/git-to-book-docs](https://github.com/diversen/git-to-book-docs)) or on the gittobook.org website location ([http://gittobook.org/books/47/git-to-book-docs](http://gittobook.org/books/47/git-to-book-docs)). This is the repo used to generate the git-to-book-docs. You can  also fork it and suggest edits. This document is just a simple `README.md`. 

If you work on a larger book you can just add some directories to keep you content better organised. The file structure is parsed so that any directories are first examined for markdown files, which should end on the `.md` extension. The way a directory is listed resembles the way [http://github.com](http://github.com) displays files, when looking at a repository online. This means directories are displayed first, and then files. In order to keep you files in the right order you can add e.g. `01-`, `02-` etc. in front of directories and documents, as this will give you the sorting you want. 

Mindre test
-----------

Images should be placed in a directory called images at base level of the git repo. 

And then images are inserted as normal: 

e.g: 

    ![gittobook image](images/gittobook.png "Gittobook logo")

Becomes:

![gittobook image](images/gittobook.png "Gittobook logo")

## Pandoc config / meta.yaml

The gittobook will prepend a `meta.yaml` file if one is found (for adding meta data to the document - such as author, title, cover-image, build commands, etc). In the `meta.yaml` you can (and should) specify title, author, and other meta info used with pandoc. This is quite a simple `meta.yaml`. 

~~~yaml

If there is not found any meta.yaml, then the books will be built with some default options. Title becomes `Unknown` and author becomes `John Doe`. If there is no `cover-image` (for Epubs and Mobi files), then the system will generate a default cover image.

You can also specify build commands used, when pandoc executes the command. You can see an example here: [https://github.com/diversen/git-to-book-docs/blob/master/meta.yaml](https://github.com/diversen/git-to-book-docs/blob/master/meta.yaml). You will see that the `format-arguments` are specific to gittobook, otherwise it is a standard pandoc `.yaml file`. The `format-arguments` are the command line options given to pandoc. You can also add files to `ignore-files`, e.g. `README.md`. 

If there is no `format-arguments` then some default `format-arguments` will be used. 

## Pandoc options

The following pandoc options are allowed in the online version. If you build the software youself all options are allowed. Note: These descriptions are taken from pandoc documentation. 

Produce typographically correct output, converting straight quotes to curly quotes:

    -S
    --smart

Specify the base level for headers (defaults to 1)

    --base-header-level=[1-6]

Produce output with an appropriate header and footer.

    -s
    --standalone

Include an automatically generated table of contents

    --toc

Specify the number of section levels to include in the table of contents. The default is 3

    --toc-depth=[1-6]

Syntax highlight filter: Options are pygments (the default), kate, monochrome, espresso, zenburn, haddock, and tango.

    --highlight-style=[string]

Produce a standalone HTML file with no external dependencies, images and css will be embeded. 

    --self-contained

Produce HTML5 instead of HTML4. 

    --html5

Treat top-level headers as chapters in LaTeX, ConTeXt, and DocBook output.

    --chapters

Number section headings in LaTeX, ConTeXt, HTML, or EPUB output.

    -N
    --number-sections

Use the specified CSS file to style the EPUB

    --epub-stylesheet

Headers level in epub files. 

    --epub-chapter-level=[1-6]

Embed a epub font

    --epub-embed-font=[path/to/font]

Pandoc variables. 
 
    -V=variable 

Allowed subset of variables: 

    geometry:margin
    documentclass
    lang

Vairable example: 

    -V sansfont=Arial -V fontsize=12pt -V version=1.10

## Flaf

When using pandoc for transformation of e.g. chinese you will need to change your font in order to get a readable result. Here are a list of fonts on the server. If you install local you will usually be able to get a font list with the command `fc-list`. 

This is the fonts on the server: 

<https://github.com/diversen/git-to-book-docs/blob/master/font-list>

In order to use e.g. chinese you will se that a chinese font exists:   `WenQuanYi Micro Hei Mono` is the font name. Found on line 529. 

In your meta tag you should add something like the following. 

    format-arguments:
        pdf: > 
            -V mainfont='WenQuanYi Micro Hei Mono' 
            -V sansfont='WenQuanYi Micro Hei Mono' 
            -V monofont='WenQuanYi Micro Hei Mono'

# Install local

## Requirements: 

* Apache2
* php5 >= 5.5
* mysql-server
* pandoc
* texlive-full (for PDF support)
* extra fonts - sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
* kindlegen (for Mobi support)

## Build

The source code can be found on: [https://github.com/diversen/php-git-to-book](https://github.com/diversen/php-git-to-book). 

First clone the base system into e.g. yoursite: 

    git clone https://github.com/diversen/php-git-to-book example.com

Enter the base system: 

    cd yoursite
    
Install dependencies. May take some time: 
    
    composer update

Enable apache2 host:

    // you will need to be root
    sudo ./coscli.sh apache2 --en example.com

Run install command: 

    ./coscli.sh prompt-install --install

You will be asked about DB configuration,  and version to install. Use a `tag` or `master`. After writing the `config/config.ini` file the system will install all the profile modules from git repos. At last the system will prompt you for a super user. Enter an email and password

Set correct perms for public files after install (e.g. upload folder)

    // you will need to be root user as we change
    // the perms to be www-data
    sudo ./coscli.sh file --chmod-files

We use a extra public directory, which you will need to add manual:

    mkdir htdocs/books
    
Set correct ownership:
    
    sudo chown www-data:www-data htdocs/books

Go to http://example.com and log in and add a repo. 

## System config

If you make the above install, then the system is multi user by default. But you can make a few configuration changes in order to change this. This shows the default `gitbook.ini` file which is located in `modules/gitbook`.

~~~ini
; who can use it
; user is a user which has signed up - 
; admin is created in the install proces
gitbook_allow = 'user'
; who is allowed to use the all options in meta.yaml
; insert unescaped inline HTML for e.g. videos
gitbook_allow_ext = 'admin'
; for 'gitbook_allow' only these formats works
gitbook_exports = 'epub,html,pdf'
; assets allowed for 'gitbook_allow'
gitbook_allow_assets = 'css,jpeg,jpg,png,gif'
